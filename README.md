# 📌 Flirt Detection NLP Project

This repository contains an end-to-end **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** project that predicts whether a message is **flirt** or **not flirt** using multiple machine learning models.  
It also includes **WhatsApp-style chat analytics** such as talkativeness, activity patterns, media counts, and missed-call detection.

## 🚀 Project Features

### 🔹 Flirt Message Classification  
The notebook explores multiple machine learning models:

- CountVectorizer + Logistic Regression  
- CountVectorizer + Multinomial Naive Bayes  
- CountVectorizer + K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- TF-IDF Vectorizer + Logistic Regression
- TF-IDF Vectorizer + Multinomial Naive Bayes
- TF-IDF Vectorizer + K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Data preprocessing, vectorization, model training & evaluation  

Each model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

### 🔹 WhatsApp-Style Chat Behavioural Analysis  
The second notebook performs deeper insights on chat data, including:

- **Most Talkative Person**  
- **Least Talkative Person**  
- **Most Active Day of the Week**  
- **Most Active Hour of the Day**  
- **Media Messages Count per Person**  
- **Missed Call Detection**  
- **Beautiful Gradient-Based Visualisations**
